## Laboratory 2: Introduction to Spring Framework and Spring Data

### Objective:
Explore the basic components of Spring Framework (e.g., `@Component`, `@Repository`, `@Service`), understand dependency injection and inversion of control, and learn to access SQL databases using Spring Data repositories. Build on the code developed in Laboratory 1.

### Instructions:
1. **Enhance Entity Classes**
   - Add appropriate JPA annotations to all business classes.
   - Use plural form for table names and snake_case for table and column names.
   - Ensure all relationships are bidirectional, but fetching a category should not fetch its elements by default.
   - Use client-generated UUIDs as primary keys (not generated by JPA or the database).
   - Configure the data source to use an in-memory H2 database.

2. **Create JPA Repositories**
   - Implement a repository for each business class annotated with `@Repository`.
   - The repository for elements should allow querying elements by their category.

3. **Implement Services**
   - Create a service for each business class annotated with `@Service`.
   - Use repository instances provided by the Spring container.
   - Delegate repository methods through the services.

4. **Initialize Example Data**
   - Create a data initializer annotated with `@Component` to populate the database automatically at application startup.
   - Use service instances provided by the Spring container.

5. **Implement Command Line Runner**
   - Add a command-line runner annotated with `@Component` to enable user interaction via standard input and output.
   - The runner should support the following commands:
     - List all available commands.
     - List all categories.
     - List all elements.
     - Add a new element with category selection.
     - Delete an existing element.
     - Stop the application.
   - Use service instances provided by the Spring container.
